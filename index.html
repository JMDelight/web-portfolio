          <h2 id="bio"><strong>About me</strong></h2>
          <p>
            I grew up in Boise Idaho, graduated at Boise High School in 2004 and then went on to study music at Boise State University. A few years into my program, life took me on a different path and I entered the work force.  I held various jobs, many of which were in the food service industry.  Some of my favorites included teaching the sport of fencing and being an in home caretaker.  I eventually settled into management in the food service industry.  As time passed I grew restless and decided I would go back to school and study to be a computer programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interests include gaming- computer, tabletop and board; Music- listening, playing and composing; fencing, hiking, cooking, juggling and reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really enjoy games, so much so that I have made a very basic one on this page.  Somewhere on this page there is a button that is hidden.  Your objective is to find the button.  If you do I will reward you with a poem.<span class="hidden-xs">  Here is a hint, the button is very small, it is only about the size of this letter 'm'. Also, the mouse acts kind of funny when it is hovering over the button.  I will tell you when you find it.  <span class="fun-times">Happy hunting</span></span>
          </p>
          <p class ="visible-xs-block">
            Sadly, your device is too small for this game's reward to work well, please try it in a larger window on your computer.

          The Siege of Belgrade

          An Austrian army, awfully arrayed,
          Boldly by battery besieged Belgrade.
          Cossack commanders cannonading come,
          Dealing destruction's devastating doom.
          Every endeavor engineers essay,
          For fame, for fortune fighting - furious fray!
          Generals 'gainst generals grapple - gracious God!
          How honors Heaven heroic hardihood!
          Infuriate, indiscrminate in ill,
          Kindred kill kinsmen, kinsmen kindred kill.
          Labor low levels longest, lofiest lines;
          Men march 'mid mounds, 'mid moles, ' mid murderous mines;
          Now noxious, noisey numbers nothing, naught
          Of outward obstacles, opposing ought;
          Poor patriots, partly purchased, partly pressed,
          Quite quaking, quickly 'Quarter! Quarter!' quest.
          Reason returns, religious right redounds,
          Suwarrow stops such sanguinary sounds.
          Truce to thee, Turkey! Triumph to thy train,
          Unwise, unjust, unmerciful Ukraine!
          Vanish vain victory! vanish, victory vain!
          Why wish we warfare? Wherefore welcome were
          Xerxes, Ximenes, Xanthus, Xavier?
          Yield, yield, ye youths! ye yeomen, yield your yell!
          Zeus', Zarpater's, Zoroaster's zeal,
          Attracting all, arms against acts appeal!
